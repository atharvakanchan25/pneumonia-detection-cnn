Additional Considerations
Make sure to include any specific versions of the libraries if needed. For example, if you're using TensorFlow 
2.4.0, you can specify it like this: tensorflow==2.4.0.
If you're using GPU support, you may need to include specific TensorFlow packages for GPU, like tensorflow-gpu.
If you have any additional libraries specific to your implementation or that you found useful, be sure to add them as well.
