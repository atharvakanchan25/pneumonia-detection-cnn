# Pneumonia Detection Using CNN

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the automated detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model aims to enhance early diagnosis and improve healthcare outcomes for patients at risk of pneumonia. This project was developed using Jupyter Notebook.

## Requirements
This project requires a high computational power laptop or server, such as the NVIDIA Tesla T4, to handle the training and inference processes efficiently.

## USAGE
Prepare your dataset of chest X-ray images and place them in the designated folder.
Open the Jupyter Notebook file (pneumonia_detection.ipynb) and follow the instructions provided in the notebook to train the CNN model.
After training, you can test the model on new images by running the appropriate sections in the notebook.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset available on Kaggle, containing images of X-rays classified as pneumonia or normal.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), consisting of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers and dense layers. This architecture is designed to effectively learn features from the input images for accurate pneumonia detection.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated on a test dataset, and results are presented as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance:

## Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified images.
Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Recall: Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
